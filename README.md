GWC 2019 Intro Bot
==================

Hey GWC team, you've found the starter bot! Excellent work. Before cloning a project, it's a good idea to read the README (this is the README) to underestand what a project does, requires, any special setup, etc. 

This is a very silly, simple bot, but will get us started on our way towards creating something much more interesting. Try reading the code and guessing what it does before proceeding.


Getting Started
---------------

To run the bot, you'll need the Discord Python API. You can install it by going to the root folder for this project (when you run git clone, the folder that's created is the project's "root") and running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
 
This bot contains a file, secret.txt, which must contain your bot's key. Open the file and replace its contents with your bot's key, then run min_bot.py. Of course, you'll also need to have the bot invited to our test server.
